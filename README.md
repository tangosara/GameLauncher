📌 GameLauncher
A customizable game launcher with mod and file management support

(Replace with actual image link later)

🚀 Overview
GameLauncher is a custom game launcher designed to provide features that many existing launchers lack. It allows users to:
✔️ Add games from various platforms and locations on their PC
✔️ Manage mods and trainers with a built-in mod launcher option
✔️ Open game directories for quick file access (useful for modding or tweaks)
✔️ Launch games directly from one centralized interface

Currently, I have already built a functional version using Python, but the UI is very basic. My goal is to rebuild this with a better interface and possibly use a different programming language to enhance its design and functionality.

🎯 Current Features
✅ Game Management: Add any game from your PC by specifying:
The game's executable file (for direct launch)
A mod launcher (if available)
The game directory (for easy file access)
✅ Multiple Launch Options: Click on a game to:
Run the base game
Open the mod launcher
Open the game directory
(Screenshots of the current version will be added here)

🔥 Future Plans
🔹 Improved UI: Create a cleaner, modern-looking UI similar to popular launchers
🔹 Better Tech Stack: Possibly switch from Python to a different language for performance and design improvements
🔹 More Features:

Custom categories for better game organization
Cloud sync for game metadata
Customizable themes
🛠️ Tech Stack (Current & Future)
Current Version: Python (basic UI)
Potential Future Tech:
C# with WPF / WinUI 3 (for a native Windows experience)
Electron (JavaScript) (if cross-platform is needed)
Flutter (Dart) (if targeting modern UI design)
