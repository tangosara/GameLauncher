*A customizable game launcher with mod and file management support*

## 🚀 Overview
**GameLauncher** is a custom game launcher designed to provide features that many existing launchers lack. It allows users to:  

✔️ Add games from various platforms and locations on their PC  
✔️ Manage mods and trainers with a built-in mod launcher option  
✔️ Open game directories for quick file access (useful for modding or tweaks)  
✔️ Launch games directly from one centralized interface  

Currently, I have already built a **functional version** using Python, but the UI is very basic. My goal is to **rebuild this with a better interface** and possibly use a different programming language to enhance its design and functionality.
