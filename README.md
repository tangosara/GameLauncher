## 🚀 Overview
**GameLauncher** is a custom game launcher designed to provide features that many existing launchers lack. It allows users to:  

✔️ Add games from various platforms and locations on their PC  
✔️ Manage mods and trainers with a built-in mod launcher option  
✔️ Open game directories for quick file access (useful for modding or tweaks)  
✔️ Launch games directly from one centralized interface  

Currently, I have already built a **functional version** using Python, but the UI is very basic. My goal is to **rebuild this with a better interface** and possibly use a different programming language to enhance its design and functionality.

## 🎯 Current Features
- ✅ **Game Management:** Add any game from your PC by specifying:  
  - The game's executable file (for directly launching the game) 
  - A mod launcher (if available)  
  - The game directory (for easy file access)
  - Add a tag/category (for easy sorting)
- ✅ **Multiple Launch Options:** Click on a game to:  
  - Run the base game  
  - Open the mod launcher  
  - Open the game directory
  - Edit name, directories, and tags
